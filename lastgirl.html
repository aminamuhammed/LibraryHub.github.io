               <p>The Last Girl: My Story of Captivity, and My Fight Against the Islamic State is a memoir by Nadia Murad, a Yazidi activist and former captive of the Islamic State. The book is about Murad's experiences during the Second Iraqi Civil War, when she was kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery by Islamic State militants in 2014. Murad's story includes her childhood in Kocho, Iraq, the massacre of her village, her captivity, and her fight against the Islamic State. The book also includes historical context and an introduction to the Yazidi faith.</p>
               <p>Murad's story has been described as harrowing, inspiring, and courageous. Some say that the book has forced the world to pay attention to the ongoing genocide in Iraq, and that anyone who wants to understand the Islamic State should read it.</p>
